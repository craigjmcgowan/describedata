This package contains functions written to replicate certain data
analysis actions that I’ve found helpful in biostatistical and
epidemiological research. It also contains R replicas of some functions
from SAS and Stata to conduct similar analyses and display the results
in a similar manner to the functions of those programs. Note that there
has not been a concerted effort to fully replicate those all aspects of
these functions - more functionality may be added on in the future but
the current focus has been on aspects of the functions that have seemed
most useful. If there is additional functionality you’d like to see
included, please submit an issue on
[GitHub](https://github.com/craigjmcgowan/describedata).
