helpR: Misc. helper functions and statistical program replicas
--------------------------------------------------------------

This package contains functions I've written to replicate certain data analysis actions that I've found helpful in biostatistical and epidemiological research. It also contains R replicas of some functions from SAS and Stata to conduct similar analyses and display the results in a similar way to the functions of those programs. I haven't made any effort to fully replicate those functions - more functionality may be added on in the future but I've focused on those aspects of the functions that have been useful to me.
